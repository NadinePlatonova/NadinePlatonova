- ⚡ Fun facts:
  •	I'm afraid of the cold, even though I lived in Chukotka for many years, where winters lasted 9 months with temperatures as low as -40 to -50°C.
  •	During the pandemic, my best friend and I created a YouTube channel with 100+ subscribers. We posted ukulele covers of our favorite songs and tutorials, which helped us cope with the stress.
  •	After moving to Montenegro, I joined a local quiz with other Russian speakers. We’re the only Russian-speaking team and often secure 1st-4th place... from the bottom!
